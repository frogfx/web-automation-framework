# Web automation framework

Project started from live Selenium testing project.

In this project I'm implementing parts of an automation framework which is improving day by day. So far I've done:
- Base test case to manage webdriver creation and quitting
- Page object model
- Page factory
- Preventing the use of the webdriver in the test themselves by narrowing access of the driver to page objects and their actions
- Parameterized data either from hardcoded object data or reading from Excel file
- Ready conditions for page objects
